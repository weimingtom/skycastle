Skycastle aims to build a game engine with integrated editing capabilities, for creating various multiplayer games and environments, from simple board games to fully featured graphical MMO:s.

Various procedural content editors are planned, as well as simple scripting and UI editors.

The game server utilizes Project Darkstar for easy scalability and persistence, and JMonkeyEngine for client side 3D graphics.  The client will be launchable directly from a browser using Java Webstart, as well as downloadable.

Skycastle is coded in the Scala language.

This is a partial rewrite of old code (hosted on Sourceforge).
